## Tutorials

First, there were the tutorials at OBA Oosterdok - a cool library ðŸ“š

The very first one I attended was on [Py03](https://github.com/Cheukting/py03_101), we went through some exercises on writing Python modules in Rust ðŸ¦€

Then, we worked on writing some [Polars plugins](https://github.com/MarcoGorelli/cookiecutter-polars-plugins).

## The conference

The event took place in a cool location in Amsterdam North, at Kromhouthal. I have to say that everything was well-organized, and the event was very professional.
