## Introduction

I have finally decided to learn Rust ðŸ¦€

More important, my approach would be the one of **learning in public** hence, I am also coming back to this blog after some time.

## Learning

I am going to use the [100 Exercises To Learn Rust](https://rust-exercises.com/) by Luca Palmieri which seems great!

As suggested on the website, I have forked the repository and made my own, which you can find here: <https://github.com/mattcristal/100-exercises-to-learn-rust>

Will have some updates soon! ðŸ‘‹
