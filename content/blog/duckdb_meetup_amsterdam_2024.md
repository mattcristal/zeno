## Meetup

Last Thursday I went to the Miro headquarter in Amsterdam to attend my first DuckDB meetup 🦆

## DuckDB

[DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/) is a very powerful and easy-to-use in-memory database.

Here Hannes Mühleisen - one of the creators - compared DuckDB to a burger 🍔 - I guess here no puns intended.

The point being that DuckDB cares a lot about the user experience, in addition to the 'core' which is the RDBMS part.
