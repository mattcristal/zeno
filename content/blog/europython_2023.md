## The conference

This July I attended my *first* Python conference: EuroPython2023 in Prague üá®üáø

The whole event was cool and the community very welcoming. I fully subscribe to Brett Cannon words: *"I came for the language, but I stayed for the community."*

I listened to talks on important libraries like ü¶ã `HTTPX`, üêª‚Äç‚ùÑÔ∏è `polars` and ü¶Ü`DuckDB` given by key contributors and maintainers.

Indeed, programmers really embrace emojis, but also animals. For example, Pedro Holanda explains the origin of DuckDB's name.

## The city

During summer and with warm and sunny days Prague is really enjoyable. In particular the **Senate Gardens** below Prague Castle is such a well-maintained and peaceful green space where you can spot unanticipated guests.

Heading then back down to the city, you can also notice a **Banksy**

Another surprise was also the **medovik** being served as dessert at the conference and in most places around Prague. A sophisticated sweet which existence I ignored until a week weeks before.

But something that Netlify reminded me again today of üç∞
